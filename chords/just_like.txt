G      C     Am* G 
Nobody feels any pain 
G            C       Am*       G 
Tonight as I stand inside the rain 
C       Am
Ev'rybody knows 
     C            Am
That Baby's got new clothes 
    C    Am G      C                 D
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows 
     Em     C      D
Have fallen from her curls. 

    G          D      C
She takes just like a woman,
        G          D      C
And she aches just like a woman 
        G          D      C
And she wakes just like a woman, 
             Am                        G
Yea, but she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend 
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again 
Nobody has to guess 
That Baby can't be blessed 
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest 
With her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls. 

       B7                   
It was raining from the first 
And I was dying there of thirst 
     Em           B7  Em
So I came in here 
         B7
And your long-time curse hurts 
But what's worse 
        C
Is this pain in here 
        Am
I can't stay in here 
C        Am 
Ain't it clear that
G
I just don't fit 

Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit 
And when we meet again 
Introduced as friends 
Please don't let on that you knew me when 
I was hungry and it was your world.
