Let us exclaim! In wonder watch each other
These flowery words -- avoiding them don't bother
Let us exchange kind and loving comments
Aren't all of these things love's happiest moments?

Friends, let us weep, with no shame whatsoever
Whether we're alone, and whether we're together
And please do not attach, meaning to the sorrow
Melancholy today, foreshadows love tomorrow

Let us understand, not having to explain
So that our mistakes will not repeat again
Let us live like this, indulging in each other
For life is very short, and we don't have another
