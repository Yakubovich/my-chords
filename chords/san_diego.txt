G                         B7                Em7              G   G7 
   Never saw the morning, 'til I stayed up all night
C                         D                      G           Em7   G7 
   Never saw the sunshine, 'til you turned out the light
C                         D                        G         Em7   G7 
   Never saw my hometown, until I stayed away too long
C                            D                C              G
   Never heard the melody, 'til I needed the song
 

   Never saw the white line, 'til I was leaving you behind
   Never knew I needed you, 'til I was caught up in a bind
   Never spoke I love you, until I cursed you in vain
   Never felt my heart-strings, 'til I nearly went insane
 

   Never saw the east coast 'til I moved to the west
   Never saw the moonlight, until it shone off of your breast
   Never saw your heart, 'til someone tried to steal it away
   Never saw your tears, until they rolled down your face
