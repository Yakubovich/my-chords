G
I lit out from Reno,
      C
I was trailed by twenty hounds
G
Didn't get to sleep that night
          C
'Till the morning came around.

    D
    Set out runnin' but I take my time
      Am
    A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
       D
    If I get home before daylight,
      Am                  C       D
    I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe,
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills.

    Chorus

I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill
And vanished in the air.

    Chorus

D
Got two reasons why I cry
D
Away each lonely night,
    C
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
    C                          C  C#
And she's my hearts delight.
    D
The second one is prison, baby,
    D
The sheriff's on my trail,
    Am
And if he catches up with me,
     C                D
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe,
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child,
But it don't look like me.

    Chorus
