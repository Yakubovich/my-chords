Am                         Dm
Your watermark smile, your ink-stained eyes
     G7                   C
That old-fashioned style, in which you say your goodbyes
Your timid brown skirts, your new leather gloves
The saints you convert, and the faith they dream of

 C                       G7
 Some sunsets I see, are too strange to paint
                           C
 And they are to me, more divine than the saints
 When we try to explain, what we see above 
 You call it rain, and I call it love

You say you believe, in nothing but facts
The snow and the leaves, and man's mortal acts
Blindly you reach, into the unknown
And bravely preach, that we're all alone

 There are no mistakes, and all thoughts are real
 Regardless of your take on what it is you feel
 At the end of the day, there's only one world
 No matter to whom you pray, or the stories you've told

And yet on some nights, when dreams intertwine
I see with your sight, and you see with mine
Both dreams are true, and together complete
So my faith is in you, and others like us I meet
