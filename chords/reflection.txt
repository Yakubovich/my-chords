A                             D
Jews say the messiah comes tomorrow
                                      A
And Christians await their lord's return
                             D7               G
Pessimists think that we'll die of global warming
            A           D        E       A
And humourists will laugh and watch us burn

Communists wave their bloody banners
Pacifists complain but will not fight
And I sit here and watch this mess they call a world
Can no longer tell my left from right 

What if the Yankees dropped a nuke in the desert?
Philosophers could say 'twould make no sound
Why do the CEO's live their lives for money
But jump off buldings when it's found?

Sheep will follow their trustworthy shepherd
And most people like to do the same
I prefer to walk alone but maybe it's because
I don't know how to play this game

Optional chorus:

This old planet keeps on spinning
Some people are losing, some are winning 
Each day some born, each day some die 
Nobody is sure for whom and why
