INTRO: F5  A#5  G#5  C#5 

F5    A#5   G#5    C#5 
Load up on guns and bring your friends 
F5    A#5    G#5        C#5 
It's fun to lose and to pretend 
F5     A#5          G#5  C#5 
She's over bored and self assured 
F5  A#5  G#5   C#5 
Oh no, I know a dirty word 

Chorus:

    F5      A#5     G#5     C#5 
    Hello,  hello,   hello, how low? x4 
    
    F5        A#5     G#5         C#5 
    With the lights out    it's less dangerous 
    F5     A#5    G#5    C#5 
    Here we are now,    entertain us 
    F5   A#5     G#5     C#5 
    I feel stupid     and contagious 
    F5     A#5   G#5     C#5 
    Here we are now,    entertain us 
    F5  A#5     G#5  C#5 
    A mulatto   An albino 
    F5   A#5   G#5  C#5 
    A mosquito   My Libido 
    
    F5 E5  F5 F#5    F5 E5  F5   A#5 G#5 
    hey! 
    F5 E5  F5 F#5    F5 E5  F5   A#5 G#5 
    hey! 


I'm worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed 
Our little group has always been 
And always will until the end 

Chorus

And I forget   just why  I taste 
oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile 
I found it hard, it`s hard to find 
Oh well, whatever, nevermind 

Chorus
