A travelling musician -- he's kissing his trumpet

Fragments in the morning, so meaningless and free

It isn't you he loves,     my God, snap out of it

Lean your shoulder against me, 

                         your shoulder against me



For the third day,    he lives in that hotel room

Where a cot by the window       is only one Ruble

And on his trumpet he        like a heated teapot

Is sighing heavily...     and I love you, my dear



You listen   to him           
                              pensive   and timid

Like a nightingales' song 
                        like the rain 
                                    like the surf

His trumpet's inflamed throat 
                             desperately croaking

The horn, and of the horn, 
                       to the horn about the horn



The trumpeter plays,        flourishes and scales

He sweats, and he coughs, and croaks out his tune

A portrait of fate   --   all in the window frame

It isn't you   he loves     but I   love only you



I'll wait for better days and wear a new raincoat

Swim in front of you like a leaf late in the fall

Do I ask for too much,     all things considered?

Is my life not sweet,        simply revering you?


I cannot tempt you with fine food or with dresses

To the musician's horn,   it's too easy to relate

The whole world next to him 
                        his brass trumpet burning

The fate, of fate, to fate  
                          with fate 
                                   about the fate
