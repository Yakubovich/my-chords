All of our meetings, alas, are destined to end
By the fir tree a somber stream bends
Under the fire, red coals timidly shift
The end has come! Suddenly, cold, calm and swift

	Dear forest sun, I do not know when
	I just hope that one
	Day we'll meet again

The tents fold their wings, their flight is through
Spreading its wings, the plane leaves you out of view
Soon our homes will be seen through the clouds ahead
Now this is real, a chasm between us has spread

	Chorus

Do not cheer me up, I do not need your words
I need that stream, and the welcoming song of the birds
And through the fog, a hint of bright, dancing flames
And by the fire, friends calling my name

	Chorus
