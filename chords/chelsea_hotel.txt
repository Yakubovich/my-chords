Chelsea Hotel

written by Leonard Cohen

Capo 5th fret

Intro: C

     C          G            F        C
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
                      G            Am
You were talking so brave and so sweet
 C         G          F       C
Giving me head on the unmade bed
           F                        G
While the limousines wait in the street
  Am                         F
Those were the reasons and that was New York
         C               E/b            Am
We were running for the money and the flesh
      F                           C
And that was called love for the workers in song
           F                         G
Probably still is for those of them left

        F             C
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe
                      E/b          Am
You just turned your back on the crowd
 F                          C
You got away, I never once heard you say
   F                 C
I need you, I don't need you
   F                 C
I need you, I don't need you
    F                    Am      G
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music."

And then you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

         C          G                      F      C
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
                      G            Am
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
     C          G            F        C
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
       F                                   G
That's all, I don't even think of you that often
