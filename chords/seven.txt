Intro - E E G E D C B x4

B         E             G E D C B
I'm gonna fight 'em off
               E             G   E  D C B
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
                        E E G E D C B
They're gonna rip it off
               E             G   E  D C B
Taking their time right behind my back
        E          G     E  D   C
And I'm talkin' to myself at night
           B          E E G E D C B
Because I can't forget
E              G     E  D   C
Back and forth through my mind
         B         E E G E D C B
Behind a cigarette

         G                     A                          
And the message comin' from my eyes says leave it alone...


  Repeat intro

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch you comin' back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones says find a home...

  Repeat intro

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the saw
Make a sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains comin' from my blood tell me "Go back home"...
