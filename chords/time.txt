D
The smart money's on Harlem
D
And the moon is in the street
    G               A7               D  
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws
           D                  A7 
And you're east of East Saint Louis
        D
And the wind is making speeches
        G                           A7
And the rain sounds like a round of applause


D
Napoleon is weeping
D
In the carnival saloon
       G        A7             D
His invisible fiance's in the mirror
        D             A7
And the band is going home
             D
It's raining hammers, it's raining nails
     G                                  A7
It's true there's nothing left for him down here


CHORUS:

         D     A7    D 
And it's time, time, time
         G     D     A7 
And it's time, time, time
         D     F#m   G              Em
And it's time, time, time, that you love
         D     A7    D
And it's time, time, time


VERSE 2:

D
And they all pretend they're orphans
D
And their memory's like a train
        G              A7                   D
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
        D                  A7
And the things you can't remember
         D
Tell the things you can't forget
     G                             A7 
That history puts a saint in every dream

D
Well she said she'd stick around
D
Until the bandages came off
          G                A7                 D
But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit
       D                 A7
And Matilda asks the sailors
          D
Are those dreams or are those prayers?
     G                          A7
So close your eys, son and this won't hurt a bit


CHORUS...


VERSE 3:

D
Well things are pretty lousy
D
For a calendar girl
    G                    A7                D
The boys just dive right off the cars and into the street
    D                 A7
And when they're on a roll
            D
She pulls a razor from her boot
      G                                A7
And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet


D
So put a candle in the window
D
And a kiss upon his lips
       G                A7                D
As the dish outside the window fills with rain
D                A7
Just like a stranger
         D
With the weeds in your heart
    G                                A7
And pay the fiddler off 'till I come back again


CHORUS x2
