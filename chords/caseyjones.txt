Chorus:

  C                          F
  Driving that train, high on cocaine,
  F                                C
  Casey jones is ready, watch your speed.
  C                      F
  Trouble ahead, trouble behind,
  F                                        C
  And you know that notion just crossed my mind.


C                       D
This old engine makes it on time,
F                                            G
Leaves central station 'bout a quarter to nine,
C                              D
Hits river junction at seventeen to,
       F                                          G
At a quarter to ten you know it's travlin' again.


  Chorus


C                      D
Trouble ahead, lady in red,
F                                     G
Take my advice you'd be better off dead.
C                                         D
Switchman's sleeping, train hundred and two is
F                                    G
On the wrong track and headed for you.

C                                  D
Trouble with you is the trouble with me,
       F                                  G
Got two good eyes but you still don't see.
C                                        D
Come round the bend, you know it's the end,
       F                                     G
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams...
