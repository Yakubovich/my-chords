In the distant mountains, I have left my heart
Now heartless I walk, on plains by the creeks
And when we're together, and when we're apart
I silently dream of these blue, frozen peaks

	When we depart - walk, fly or ride
	Mount our cars, and finish the journey
	So empty the roads will be without our strides
	And our dear peaks, so lonesome in mourning

On the difficult path, still lies my heart
By the rocky ranges, the cliffs and the ridges
There lies my heart, refusing to part
A radio signal our distant worlds bridges

	Chorus

And so I pretend, that my life goes just fine
I try to smile at my friends' jokes and stories
But to this abandoned, grave heart of mine
I'll have to return, to the mountains' glory

	Chorus
