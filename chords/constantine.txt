     Boats Full of Mullets
___________________________________________

Constantine  brought   into Odessa
Boats full of   mullets  every day
And when into   the bar he entered
Dock workers rose   without  delay

The sea is blue, the chestnut's blooming --
This  is  Odessa   in  the  spring!
And Constantine      so unassuming
Takes his guitar  and softly sings:
    
      I cannot speak for all Odessa
      It's the largest city I have seen
      But both Moldovanka  and  Peresep
      Adore  the sailor Constantine

One day a  fishergirl  named Sonya
Turning her boat towards the shore
Told him   "Everyone here knows ya 
But I  have not   seen you  before"

Opening a Kazbek  pack he told her
His manner  very   calm  and plain
"You're a funny girl    dear Sonya
But just for you    I will explain:

      Chorus

The Fountain was covered in blossoms,
Flowers bloomed  at French Boulevard,  
And in the port the shouts were awesome:
"Our Constantine   just fell in love!"

Among the fishermen these news
Were talked about   for a week.
At the wedding the workers' shoes
Were put on with a frightnin squeek.

      I cannot speak for all Odessa
      It's the largest city I have seen
      For a day celebrated all Peresep
      The wedding of the sailor Constantine.
