If I ever fall ill,
I will not go to see any doctors
I'll turn to you my friends -
And will ask you to make my bed
Lay me down on the steppe
Hang up the fog as my curtain
And a fallen star
I will ask to place over my head

I have always been blunt
I never did cautiously tread
If I ever get wounded
In an honest and difficult fight
With the Russian road
I will ask you to bandage my head
In autumn flowers
Cover me for my final night

Vastness and eternity
Blow from the mountains and shores
Once you see them you know:
Eternal are our days
I won't be leaving through
A hospital corridor
I'll be leaving you through
The magical milky way
