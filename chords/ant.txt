We all need   someone  we can pray to
Even the tiny ant once felt  impelled
Humbly on his knees  to find a way to
Believe    in this captivating  spell

The ant became then very discontented
Disillusioned   with the mundane norm
And for himself a goddess he invented
According to his own  spirit and form 

And on the seventh night,
                    one sudden moment
She appeared   in front his very door
Without a   divine miracle    or omen
A simple  light  sun dress  she  wore

Not letting her   for a moment linger
Forgetting all  - victories & defeats
He kissed her thin and weathered
                              fingers
And the old, worn shoes   on her feet

By the doorstep,      shadows swaying
They conversed without a single sound
Fair and wise as gods   while staying
Sorrowful  like mortals on the ground
