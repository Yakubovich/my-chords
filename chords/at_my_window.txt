D
At my window
              G
watching the sun go
            A
hoping the stars know
G            D
it's time to shine
D
daydreams
         G
aloft on dark wings
            A
soft as the sun streams
G           D
at days decline

A
Living is laughing
G                     D
dying says nothing at all
A
baby and I are laying here
G                     D
watching the evening fall

Time flows
through brave beginnings
and she leaves her endings
beneath our feet
walk lightly
upon their faces
leave gentle traces
upon their sleep

Living is dancing
dying does nothing at all
baby and I are laying here
watching the evening fall

Three dimes
hard luck and good times
fast lines and low rhymes
ain't much to say
Feel fine
feel low and lazy
feel grey and hazy
feel far away

Living is sighing
dying ain't flying so high
baby and I are lying here
watching the day go by
