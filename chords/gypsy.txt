My Gypsy Song

In my dream - a fire burns,
and as I sleep I'm moaning:
"Wait for the light to return -
not too long till morning!"
But the morning's wrong - unreal
All the joy is over:
I just smoke before the meal
Sometimes drink,  hungover.

	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...

In the bars - the light is dim,
and the fools and paupers
fill their glasses to the brim,
For me it's wrong - improper.
To the church I turn my head,
in search for salvation...
But the church's bell is dead,
Just an immitation!

	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...

To the mountains then I flee,
gasping for thin air, -
on the peak an alder tree,
and at the bottom - pears.
If only grass grew on the slope -
even that would suffice
just one thing to bring me hope...
But there's no grass, just ice

	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...

Searched the fields, along the stream:
Day or night - no God!
Just this lonesome gypsy theme,
and the stretching road.
By the road - thick forests grow.
Fiends and witches lurking.
At the end of it, I know -
the axeman's smirking

	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...

Prancing wildly, to the song,
seven wayward horses.
Along the road, all is wrong,
and the end is worse.
In the church, or in the bar -
nothing's ever sacred!
No my friends, all places are -
and always been foresaken

	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
	One time, and one more time,
	Many, many, many times...
