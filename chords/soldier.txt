A soldier lived upon this Earth
handsome, brave and able
But you couldn't see his worth
For he was made of paper

He had plans to change the world
As your heroic saviour
But on a thread the soldier twirled
He was made of paper

For you he would, in flame and smoke
Die waving his sabre
But to you he was a joke
For he was made of paper

For him his fate was far too tame
And he was so much braver
Forgetting, as he begged for flames
That he was made paper

The flame? Well, then step ahead!
And so he drew his rapier
And there he burned, for like I said
He was just made of paper
