Morning Memories
-----------------

The night dies quickly, morning comes;
The moon defeated by the sun.
Alarm clocks ring like battle drums;
The fears of dark become undone.

He wakes up slowly, wears his shirt;
She never left his mind.
No doubt he has been deeply hurt
And knows too well her kind.

He walks towards the window frame
And sees the bright sun rise.
He briefly smiles and turns away -
The sun erased her eyes.

Outside the sun is blazing hot,
And people just don't care.
He changed so much; the world has not -
Same grass, same streets, same air

He strolls about the frozen park,
And sees two lovers kiss.
His hands grow cold, his eyes turn dark,
Not quite expecting this.

He thinks he would feel envy then,
Reflect on what was lost.
He thinks he would love her again,
No matter at what cost.

He thinks he would call them naive;
They live a dream - a lie.
But that he too can not achieve,
He sighs and passes by.
