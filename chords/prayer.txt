Prayer

My Lady, I've never claimed to know you
Forgive me for my disbelief
For ignoring all that they taught me
For seeing in your eyes cold sleet
You cry as the planet is burning
As black clouds cover the sun
Each day you keep the Earth turning
And on it, some boy loads a gun

How can it be that I hear you
While those who listen do not
My Lady, they won't forgive me
For singing these unholy thoughts
But it's not for our sins that you're crying
But for your own misquoted words
As you see new children trying
To lift their fathers' old swords

They say that to us you're a mother
Does this mean I'm a son to you?
If you comfort me when I'm crying
Can I not do the same, too?
Can I not tell you I love you
Will love you as long as I live
And kiss these tears in your eyes
Even if I don't believe?
