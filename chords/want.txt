Capo 5th

    C 
The guilty undertaker sighs,
    Em   
The lonesome organ grinder cries,
    Am                               G
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
    F
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
G
Blow into my face with scorn,
         Am
But it's not that way,
                 G
I wasn't born to lose you.
  C           Em
I want you, I want you,
  Am          G
I want you so bad, 
         C
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
They wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask me to 
Open up the gate for you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

    Em
Now all my fathers, they've gone down
     Am
True love they've been without it.
    Em
But all their daughters put me down
       F              G
'Cause I don't think about it.

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her.
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter. 
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
Was I?
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I . . . 
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.
