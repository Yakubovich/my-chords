Capo 3rd

Am             Dm      E           Am
A face with no scars, no wrinkles, no years
Am             Dm      G7           C
It knows no wars, no sadness, no tears
A                Dm         G7             C
It knows not of love, that flows down the drain
Dm         Am         E7         Am
Its creamy skin has never known pain      

It hears not a word of the world around
For ears so gentle can't bear to hear sound
They're painted on in perfect facade
The work of a mortal mimicking by God

It sees the room through a thick screen
Through oily paints of white and green
It sees the room through a disguise
Through a disguise of beautiful eyes

People walk by, and people stare
Gasping in wonder at each lock of hair
People then smile and walk away
Leaving the portrait alone for the day
