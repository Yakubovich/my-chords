"We feel and know that we are eternal"
-- Baruch Spinoza

Am                   Dm
A record spins and I listen
	   G                  Am
	to flowing hair in the wind
Am                   Dm
My heart beats to the rhythm
              E                Am
	of moth wings against skin

F           G             Am
You looked into the ocean, and now
F           G             Am
waves carry your reflection

Two clock hands cling in prayer
	tick apart as though they understand
A white lamp mocks the cold night air
	the moth escapes from my hand
	
I see your eyes in the ripples, and know
that we are eternal
