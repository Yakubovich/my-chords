Is This What You Wanted

written by Leonard Cohen

Capo 5th fret

A                           A7
You were the promise at dawn
D                    A
I was the morning after
A                            A7
You were Jesus Christ my Lord
D                   A
I was the money lender
D
You were the sensitive woman
A
I was the very reverend Freud
D
You were the manual orgasm
A                       E
I was the dirty little boy

        F#m
And is this what you wanted
    G                        F#m
To live in a house that is haunted
         E               A
By the ghost of you and me

     F#m
Is this what you wanted
    G                        F#m
To live in a house that is haunted
         E              A
By the ghost of you and me

You were Marlon Brando
I was Steve McQueen
You were K.Y. Jelly
I was Vaseline
You were the father of modern medicine
I was Mr. Clean
You were the whore and the beast of Babylon
I was Rin Tin Tin

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me

You got old and wrinkled
I stayed seventeen
You lusted after so many
I lay here with one
You defied your solitude
I came through alone
You said you could never love me
I undid your gown

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me

I mean is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me

That's right, is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted...
