    E  
A modern-day warrior  
Mean mean stride,  
Today's Tom Sawyer 
           E E  E D  E A  E C  
Mean mean pride.  


    E E  
          Though his mind is not for rent,  
    E D  
          Don't put him down as arrogant.  
    E A  
          His reserve, a quiet defense,  
    E C                            C G A  
          Riding out the day's events.  
    C    G A    E E  E D  E A   C B A G F# E  
    The ri-ver

          E             F#            G        A  
        And what you say about his company  
            E        C           B  A  
        Is what you say about society.  
        E        F#    G            A  
        Catch the mist, catch the myth  
        E         C           B        A         
        Catch the mystery, catch the drift.

        The world is, the world is,  
        A        G         B  
        Love and life are deep,  
        A             G     A   E  
        Maybe as his eyes are wide.  


E  
Today's Tom Sawyer,  
He gets high on you,  
And the space he invades  
He gets by on you.  

    E E   E D   E A   E C  
    
    E E  
          No, his mind is not for rent  
    E D  
          To any god or government.  
    E A  
          Always hopeful, yet discontent,  
    E C                                     C G A  
         He knows changes aren't permanent,  
    C    G      A     E E   E D   E A   C B A G F# E  
    But change is.  


        E F# G A E C B A  

          E             F#             G        A  
        And what you say about his company  
            E       C                B  A  
        Is what you say about society.  
        E        F#         G            A  
        Catch the witness, catch the wit  
        E        C     B             A      
        Catch the spirit, catch the spit.

             B  
        The world is, the world is,  
        A        G         B  
        Love and life are deep,  
        A             G     A   E  
        Maybe as his eyes are wide.  


E  
Exit the warrior,  
Today's Tom Sawyer,  
He gets high on you,  
And the energy you trade,  
He gets right on to the friction of the day.
