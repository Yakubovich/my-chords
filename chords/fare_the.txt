Well, the drunken clown's still (Em)hanging 'round, 
 but it's (F)plain the (Em)laughter's (Dm)all died down,
The (G)tears you tried so (F)hard to hide are (C)flowing.
And a blind man with his (Em)knife in hand has con(F)vinced 
 him(Em)self that he (Dm)understands,
I (G)wish him well, Miss Carousel, but (F)I got to be a-(C)going.
(Am) Won't you come and (Em)get me when

And (F)proudly call your (Em)name.   (G)  (G7)

Well, the (C)lady's been told that (Em)all her gold is (F)worth so (Em)much, 
 she (Dm)can't be sold,
No (G)time to weep, she'll (F)need her sleep to(C)morrow.
When she carries her face to the (Em)market place and 
 (F)bets it (Em)on the (Dm)opening race,
She can (G)ring her bells, Miss Carousel, but her (F)singing brings me (C)sorrow.

Well, it's (C)always done, every (Em)mother's son is 
 (F)shown that (Em)grown men (Dm)never run,
And (G)so they fight with (F)all the might in(C)side them.
But when their battles been fought 'n they've (Em)all been taught 
 that the (F)trick is (Em)just not (Dm)being caught
Will you (G)give 'em hell, Miss Carousel, when they're (F)begging you to (C)hide them?

When the (C)need arose, your (Em)eyes fell closed, 
 you (F)clamped your (Em)fingers a(Dm)round your nose,
(G)Would you say that's (F)any way to (C)judge him?
Well, you haven't got the au(Em)thority to (F)kill him (Em)in the (Dm)first degree,
But would you (G)feel compelled, Miss Carousel, 
 if you had (F)something to be(C)grudge him?
- Instrumental, chorus chords - 

On a (C)velvet beach far be(Em)neath the reach of 
 (F)those who (Em)come to (Dm)prie and preach,
The (G)natural man that (F)tried to stand is (C)falling.
Well, how long will it be be(Em)fore he sees you (F)own his (Em)legs, 
 but his (Dm)mind is free?
Only (G)you can tell, Miss Carousel, how (F)long will he be (C)crawling?
(Am) Won't you come and (Em)get me when
You're (Am)sure that you don't (Em)need me then,
I'll (Am)stand outside your (Em)window
And (F)proudly call your (Em)name.   (G)  (G7)

All the (C)castle walls've (Em)grown so tall, 
 (F)seems there (Em)ain't no (Dm)hope at all
To (G)reach the top, even (F)though you stop for (C)breathing.
But I ain't gonna try to (Em)make you cry, 
 the (F)teardrops (Em)couldn't (Dm)find your eyes,
It's (G)all been swell, Miss Carousel, but the (F)time has come for (C)leaving.
(Am) Won't you come and (Em)get me when

And (F)proudly call your (Em)name.   (G)   
(Am) Won't you come and (Em)get me when
You're (Am)sure that you don't (Em)need me then,
